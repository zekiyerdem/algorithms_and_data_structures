    "\n",
    "1. Breadth-First Search Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "    The BFS algorithm is used here to traverse the binary tree level by level. This ensures that the nodes closer to the root are checked for duplicates before the nodes at deeper levels. Since the problem requires returning the duplicate closest to the root, BFS is the ideal choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use of a Set to Track Seen Values: \n",
    "\n",
    "    The **seen** set is used to keep track of all values encountered during the traversal:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - When a node's value is encountered, it is checked against the seen set.\n",
    "    - If the value is already in the set, it means a duplicate has been found.\n",

    "\n",
    "    The deque from the collections module is used to implement the queue for BFS:\n",

    "    - Nodes are processed one at a time in the order they were added, ensuring level-order traversal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Edge Case Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - If the tree is empty (root is None), the function immediately returns -1, as no duplicates can exist.\n",
    "    - If no duplicates are found after traversing all nodes, the function returns -1.\n",

    "In **Assignment 1**, I developed an algorithm to identify missing values in an integer list using negative indexing. The process began with understanding the problem's requirements: to detect missing values efficiently within the constraints of an array. My approach leverages each number in the array to mark its corresponding index as negative. This method works because any index that remains positive indicates a missing value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The choice of negative indexing was both innovative and practical. It eliminated the need for additional data structures, reducing space complexity. The algorithm's simplicity also ensures it operates in linear time, making it highly efficient for large arrays. A significant realization during this process was how well the method handles duplicates. Even if a number appears multiple times, it re-marks the same index, leaving the results unaffected and ensuring missing values are still correctly identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "One challenge I faced was ensuring the algorithm correctly handles edge cases, such as empty arrays or numbers outside the expected range. By iterating through potential issues, I fine-tuned the implementation to handle all cases robustly. This assignment strengthened my understanding of in-place array manipulation and algorithm design, showcasing the power of leveraging array indices for efficient problem-solving."
